# Interactive-form-SJS-5-2021

OVERVIEW

In this project, I will use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference as part of my Treehouse FSWD Course found here..https://teamtreehouse.com/home

This project will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

With the use of Javascript I will be:-

Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
